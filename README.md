# QPI Calculator

This project is an exploration for an alternative UI for [CompSAt QPI Calculator](http://qpicalculator.compsat.org).

The current implementation uses drop-down menus for selecting everything. Inspired by
a video regarding alternatives, and the my own discomfort with the drop-down, I have
started this project.
